# flask_alchemy_rest

This library purpose is to create REST API and json-schema for that api from sqlalchemy models. Because you can create models from database automatically by using sqlalchemy reflection abilities, in the end you would have ability to create REST API for legacy databases.

The main idea that used to achieve that goal is to create graph of relationships between models, find roots in this graph (vertices with only outgoing edges) (not yet implemented, roots are specified manually), and create all possible paths from root to all reachable vertices (hierarchy_traverser.py).

This paths are later used to create links, db queries and api schema (query.py, endpoints.py, schema.py, where endpoints.py serves as factory and entry point for actual program). Json schema is created by using autogenerated marshmallow schema and transforming it to json-schema (generators.py, schema.py)
